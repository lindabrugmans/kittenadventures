                <p>Yarn is not a toy for you. It can be dangerous and make you get stuck. Stay away from it.</p>
                <p>When you see yarn, don't play with it. Let humans handle it. They will keep it safe. (i dew not agrees)</p>
                <p>It's better to play with shorter toys that humans give you. They are fun and won't get you into trouble.</p>
